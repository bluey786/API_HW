# API_HW



Part I - WeatherPy

In this example, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.





Part II - VacationPy

I'll be using my skills in working with weather data to plan for future vacations. I'll be using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.
